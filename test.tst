üå© Pentest in the clouds‚ù§Ô∏è  ‚Ä¢ Clouds are a great tool to create a convenient infrastructure for applications and services. Companies and independent developers move their projects to AWS or Azure, often without thinking about security. But in vain.  ‚Ä¢ I will share with you some resources (known vulnerable laboratories) that will help pentesters,  specialists or enthusiasts, gain practical experience in searching for vulnerabilities in cloud applications deployed on Google Cloud, AWS or Azure. Resources contain practical and theoretical material:
